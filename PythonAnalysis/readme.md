# PythonAnalysis

This consists of one class within TopasBfieldAnalysis which contains all the underlying code, and two analysis scripts:

- AnalysePurgeMagnet.py: to analyse the purging magnet example
- TopasBfieldAnalysis.py: to analyse the CST scanning magnet example

Basically the analysis mostly consists of interpolation through scatted data and comparison thereof.
