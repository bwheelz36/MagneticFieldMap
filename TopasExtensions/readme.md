# Topas extensions

The only diference between these extensions and the original is that these ones print info to the terminal. This is how I got the B field back out of topas. This is one of the potential areas where there may be an error in my analysis...

If you try and run this with the GUI, it may crash due to line 355 which attempts to print every queried field point to the screen. that seems to make the GUI crash.
